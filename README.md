## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Vanilla Javascript - For interactive mode

### What I learned

Actually for this project, i really am proud with all of my codes because i created the use of them by myself and it is actually more simple and way better now that i already do 15 projects, well 16 with this one, and i can see that myself is getting more improvement than before i learn with frontend-mentor. Although for the javascript it's still take a lot and not quite good to look at, but this is my best for now.

### Continued development

Maybe for future development i might add some improvement like the claim button to send the data to my email so i can see everyone who claimed their free trial.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwind css and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
